PostSecret
====
Here I save PostSecret images weekly.

Index pages go in `downloads/index/:datestamp`, and images go in
`downloads/images/:url`.

Download things.

    ./download.py

View the images

    ./view.sh

Generate a crontab for downloading these images every week.

    ./crontab.sh

There's a similar script [on ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/postsecret/),
but it doesn't have as much data because ScraperWiki isn't very reliable.
Regardless, it's worth converting some of that data here because it goes back further.
